# To-Do List and Notes App

People can use a to-do list app with notes to plan and manage their tasks and goals. They can make, change, and remove lists of things they have to do, and write notes for each item. The app helps them sort out their tasks, calm down, work better, be more creative, and remember more.

Data is Stored locally on device storage with the help of sqflite flutter package, which executes queries using sql commands.
